# Overview

Simple Tic Tac Toe Javascript (ES 6) application. 

This boilerplate is a set of utilities and plugins for NodeJs to tune and streamline your MDBootstrap experience for greater productivity. This boilerplate follows the Airbnb-style guide for JavaScript found [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

# Installation

First time installation process for both Free and Pro users:

```bash
npm install
```

- If you're only using the Free version, you're good to go!

<br>

- For those who use the **Pro** version, you need to send an email to contact@mdbootstrap.com and request access to the GitLab repo if you haven't done so already. Once you have access, [login and go to your settings](https://git.mdbootstrap.com/profile/), then follow the steps in the image below.
  <br>

  <br>

  Once done, the page will update and at the top, a new field will appear called **Your New Personal Access Token**.
  ![img2](https://i.imgur.com/AI5JJjp.png)

  Remember this **access token** as you'll never be able to see it again once/if you leave this page.
  With this **access token**, run the following commands inside the project, remember to replace **_ACCESS_TOKEN_** with your actual token:

  ```bash
  npm uninstall mdbootstrap
  npm install git+https://oauth2:ACCESS_TOKEN@git.mdbootstrap.com/mdb/jquery/jq-pro.git#4.7.7 --save
  ```

  **_Notice_**: _You'll get warned that there are 8 vulnerabilities through NPM, you do not need to worry about these._
  Finally, you'll need to update the paths in **/src/app.js** and **/src/scss/style.scss** from **_~mdbootstrap_** to **_~mdbootstrap-pro_**. Remember to uncomment and/or add any of the pro addons that you need.

<br>

##### Start development server

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the project with webpack-dev-server, opens in a new tab on your default browser. Live-reload enabled.

##### Building your project

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the project to **/dist/**

# Updating

When you want to update the project, it's dependencies and packages, I recommend installing npm-check-updates

```bash
npm i npm-check-updates -g
```

Once installed, run the following commands inside the repository:

```bash
ncu -u
```

If packages are updated, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Otherwise you are good to go. To update the version of MDBootstrap you use, just uninstall **mdbootstrap** through npm and re-install the package. NCU most likely will not update these packages because we currently force version 4.7.7 instead of the latest **HEAD** version.
